📑 Lab Report - ED21B014
Merged Report of Lab 1 & Lab 2
📌 Overview
This repository contains a merged PDF report of Lab 1 and Lab 2, which focuses on statistical analysis, data visualization, and hypothesis testing using Python. The labs cover key topics such as mean and deviation calculations, covariance and correlation matrices, statistical hypothesis testing, and business recommendations based on analytical findings.

📂 Contents
📖 Lab 1: Statistical Analysis & Data Visualization
Lab 1 primarily focuses on statistical computations and visualizations, covering:

Mean and Deviation Calculations

Computing sample mean for datasets
Determining deviation vectors from mean and origin
Scatter Plot & 3D Vector Representation

Visualizing data points and sample mean
Plotting deviation vectors in 3D space
Cosine Similarity & Angle Computation

Finding Euclidean norms of deviation vectors
Calculating cosine similarity and angle between vectors
Covariance & Correlation Matrices

Computing covariance matrix (Sn) and correlation matrix (R)
Understanding how variables are related in a dataset
Generalized Variance Calculation

Computing determinant of covariance matrix to analyze data spread
📖 Lab 2: Hypothesis Testing & Business Insights
Lab 2 extends the analysis to multivariate statistical testing, including:

Hotelling’s T² Test for Hypothesis Testing

Statistical inference to compare sample mean with company standards
Constructing null and alternative hypotheses
Evaluating whether data meets predefined benchmarks
Confidence Interval Estimation

Calculating univariate and simultaneous confidence intervals
Determining whether observed values deviate significantly from expectations
Business Decision Recommendations
